## Jets Project

### Week 2 Homework for Skill Distillery

#### Technologies Used
* Java classes
* Interfaces
* for loops
* if statements
* switch
* Array
* Eclipse
* Git/GitHub

#### Project Description
This was my first attempt at making a fully working program using Java's classes and Object Oriented programming. 
In this simple app, the user is able to navigate through a menu and decide how to interact with different jets. 
The user is even able to make their own plane to add to the fleet

#### How to Run This Program
When the user first loads up the application, they are prompted to enter a choice on the menu. The choices show 
you different statistics of the planes, including the fastest jet, and which one can go the furthest. The user 
can also choose to add their own jet to the fleet.

#### Lessons Learned
The hardest part of designing this app for me was the implementation of interfaces. I did not fully understand how
to use them until further research on the topic. Figuring out how all the classes and interfaces work together was
exciting and helped me better understand object orientation.
